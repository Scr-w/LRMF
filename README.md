# test
Pytorch implementation of LRMF.


By running original_train.py, you can get the results of baseline models without pruning. The pruning_cifar10.py is used to implement our pruning method. The models folder contains all the necessary code for the network definition. The functions folder contains supporting code to reproduce our work.
